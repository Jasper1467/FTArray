# FTArray
FTArray aims to efficiently manage and manipulate large arrays of data in C++. It was designed with performance and memory efficiency in mind.

# Benchmark
I used the code from FTArray.cpp to benchmark, it calculates the time used for a for loop from 0 to 1000 to complete. I did the test 1000 times and calculated the average.
**FTArray was on average 0.208530ms faster than std::vector in x64 and 0.134469ms in x86**
